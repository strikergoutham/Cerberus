# Cerberus
Cerberus is an auto monitoring script which monitors for any cloud assets of a company grouped via common ssl cert used, which might have been exposed over the internet.It uses Shodan API internally to monitor/query company infra.

This is a quick hack script if you are someone who monitors for cloud assets of any company scraped by shodan and want to get notified via slack periodically.

## Features :

> Monitors for cloud assets grouped via common ssl cert.
